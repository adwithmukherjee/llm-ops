It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I\\'m a crotchety old man, I\\'m a woman in my 20s, so I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m this movie\\'s target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid\\'s movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 0}), Document(page_content=': 1\\nReview_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: imseeg\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: 3 reasons FOR seeing it and 1 reason AGAINST.\\nReview: The first reason to go see it:\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 1}), Document(page_content=': 2\\nReview_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: Natcat87\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Too heavy handed\\nReview: As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the \"stereotypical Barbie\" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain\\'t the way to get it.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 2}), Document(page_content=': 3\\nReview_Date: 31 July 2023\\nAuthor: ramair350\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: As a guy I felt some discomfort, and that\\'s ok.\\nReview: As much as it pains me to give a movie called \"Barbie\" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I\\'m a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don\\'t agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that\\'s ok. This movie wasn\\'t designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were \"allowed\" to have \"real jobs\" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I\\'ll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 3}), Document(page_content=': 4\\nReview_Date: 24 July 2023\\nAuthor: heatherhilgers\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: A Technicolor Dream\\nReview: Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 4}), Document(page_content=\": 5\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: G-Joshua-Benjamin\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: My mom and I saw this yesterday.

The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 8}), Document(page_content=\": 9\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: hamsterination\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: It could have been so much better...\\nReview: The film's universe and settings are fantastic.

BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 12}), Document(page_content=': 13\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: jpismyname\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Fun and surprisingly touching\\nReview: I was honestly doubting this movie at first, but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lot.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 13}), Document(page_content=\": 14\\nReview_Date: 4 August 2023\\nAuthor: thePopcornExplorer\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: I don't see how it was preachy\\nReview: In this day and age with society overall becoming more and more polarized and our leaders around the world doing nothing to improve dialogue, it seems that people became broken records. Now everything in the movies and TV shows is perceived as preachy, not everything is a conspiracy, people need to consider that movies and TV shows at its core, and specially the good ones, are about sharing perspectives and allow the audience, if their minds are opened to it, to acknowledge all sides of the stories.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 14}), Document(page_content=\": 15\\nReview_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: Revuer223\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.\\nReview: The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while.

I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 18}), Document(page_content=\": 19\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: andermic18\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: No Direction\\nReview: The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 19}), Document(page_content=': 20\\nReview_Date: 1 August 2023\\nAuthor: zkonedog\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: An Amazingly Perfect Blend Of Social Satire & Fun\\nReview: For a film like \"Barbie\" to succeed, every aspect had to come together perfectly. It needed to consummately balance satire with fun, the casting had to be spot-on, and the writing/directing required to pull off such a feat would need to be exquisite. Somewhat remarkably, that is exactly what writer/director Greta Gerwig pulls off here to create the best movie of summer 2023.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 20}), Document(page_content=\": 21\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: tm-sheehan\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Didn't hit my pink spot\\nReview: My Review - Barbie\\nIn Cinemas now\\nMy Rating 6.5/10\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 21}), Document(page_content=': 22\\nReview_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: herrcarter-92161\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: Somewhat of a Jumbled Mess\\nReview: My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 22}), Document(page_content=': 23\\nReview_Date: 10 August 2023\\nAuthor: adamjohns-42575\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: A sheer pleasure to watch.\\nReview: Barbie (2023) -\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 23}), Document(page_content=': 24\\nReview_Date: 20 July 2023\\nAuthor: Genti25\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: You are Kenough\\nReview: This movie is so much fun.

It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society. Some moments were also absurd ( the fight with all the Kens). Its good anyway.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 31}), Document(page_content=': 32\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: MaskedMinty\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: Preach Preach Preach\\nReview: Let me start by saying that I\\'m by no means a conservative or traditional woman. I believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems. But damn...this movie is so corporate and shallow. It\\'s clearly ordered and tailored by executives at Mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls. The movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good, but then it just goes downhill: the premise of the owner\\'s feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a person\\'s life journey and then Barbie and Ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching. This movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling, they keep repeating the same dialogues: patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism, not even one time but MULTIPLE TIMES. These characters go into random rants like its a ted talk! The chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, You cant root for them or feel their feelings at all. Barbie should have understood how Kens had been feeling in the Barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society: just existing for the gaze of a woman (man). Yet what do they do? They manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality. (I guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh.)\\nI can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this: People are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the \"not taking itself serious\" bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids. The only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have acted very well. Besides this, they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and I would have respected the creators more. Pass.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 32}), Document(page_content=\": 33\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: anjamulder\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: not for everyone\\nReview: This is very much a movie that will get devided opinions on it, my cousin said well this is two hours of my life i will never get back, and me?

Anyway the movie was bad. These days, every other director and producer wants to convey messages about women rights and feminism through whatever platform possible and this movie was a perfect example of that with sheer cringe to convey all that. I wished I had gotten the ticket for Oppenheimer in the same timings as my sister's Barbie show.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what it is supposed to be? It's literally a movie about Barbie. Instead, it felt more like an agent of woke culture, and basically Mattel's (the company that produces Barbie dolls) way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier. It continuously tried to portray the fact that Mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls, it is now producing dolls of all colors and races. Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong. If they didn't quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous, why make the marketing events misleading? They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure. Sadly, it was not nearly as enjoyable as the misleading marketing made it seem.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 38}), Document(page_content=\": 39\\nReview_Date: 25 July 2023\\nAuthor: mr_bickle_the_pickle\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Life in plastic, it's fantastic!\\nReview: It's an incredibly fun movie. Lots of laughs. Very campy over the top humour. But also surprisingly touching. My favourite scene of the movie is just rather a small quiet moment where Barbie is observing every day life and tells an old woman how beautiful she is. Margot Robbie shines in the lead role. Ryan Gosling clearly was having a lot of fun with the role, but don't sleep on Michael Cera as Allan. I know a lot of people say that Ryan Gosling is a scene stealer, but personally I thought Michael was.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 39}), Document(page_content=': 40\\nReview_Date: 25 July 2023\\nAuthor: spika13\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Too overrated\\nReview: Its like watching at \"Truman\\'s show\" but all the set it\\'s pink color with a hint of extreme feminist ideas.

It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. Its good anyway.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 59}), Document(page_content=': 60\\nReview_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: 🏩 Possibly a Masterpiece? 💒\\nReview: I Understand that Some People are Going to Have Big Big Problems with Some of the Messaging within this Film.

The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won\\'t be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 64}), Document(page_content=': 65\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: meltingmel\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: 10/10!!!!!!!\\nReview: Wow.

The message of female empowerment was fine, but didn't really speak to gender equality. Barbieland is the opposite of real world where Barbies are in control and kens are perceived as the mindless accessories. However, the ending just puts Barbies back on top and doesn't do much to equality which I hope is our goal. The movie itself was very sloppy and all finish with no build up. You could tell the writers had ideas of what they wanted to have happen but had zero clue how to get there. They wanted Ken to take the patriarchy back to Barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the Kens being bumbling morons the entire movie. It's all payoff and no buildup. Good acting from a strong cast made this more fun to watch but when you start thinking a little deeper it didn't make much sense. I think this was a made for tik tok movie where there's 100 great scenes to throw up on the internet but not very cohesive when put together.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 71}), Document(page_content=\": 72\\nReview_Date: 20 July 2023\\nAuthor: PedroPires90\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: A triumph\\nReview: I appreciated it but wasn't a huge fan of Greta Gerwig's first two films.

A reasonable assumption could be made that a movie based on a doll so popular with pre-adolescent girls would be geared towards that audience. However, this is the era of comic book movies targeting \"grown-ups\", and since we know, based on her previous work (the exceptional LADY BIRD, 2017), Greta Gerwig is an intelligent filmmaker, a more reasonable assumption is that she purposefully aimed the movie at women who once played with Barbie dolls and now fill their days with work, family, and adulting. This strategy has proven to be box office gold, and the heavy dose of cosplay at screenings proves the lasting impact this plastic doll has had on many women who lined up for tickets.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 73}), Document(page_content=': 74\\nReview_Date: 25 July 2023\\nAuthor: Dello_\\nRating: 4\\nReview_Title: Funny and sharp first half, boring and baffling second one\\nReview: I had great expectations for the Barbie movie, mainly because of the writers (Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach) and the stellar cast with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the way.

The acting was amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was amazing. I just thought it was too on the nose. Like the message was literally forced in your face. It seemed lazy to me. I went in thinking it was going to be similar to The Truman Show and I wished it had've taken some elements from it because it would've made it much more powerful if so. I'm not going to spoil the ending but I thought the writers just gave up. Overall for me it's a 6/10. Good film but that's all. Definitely could've been less preachy. Ultimately, it's nice movie to see and I'd see it again at some point but it wasn't great.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 77}), Document(page_content=': 78\\nReview_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: acdc_mp3\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: A really fun time\\nReview: Weeks ago I heard that there was going to be a Barbie movie coming out and my immediate first thought was \"Oh, God.\" I then forgot about it and then saw the trailer for it when we went to see the new Indiana Jones movie.

I fell asleep in some scenes. There were lots of boring speeches. The movie was fun, that's obvious, but I didn't laugh much. This movie became one of the most different and crazy events of our day. I don't think it has any value as a movie. It was indeed a bad movie, but as an event it was fun. I don't regret. There were some references. I liked most of them. The acting wasn't bad, I think it was good. I was getting bored again near the end of the movie.

The way it handles its feminist message is not the best, because while it tries to give a meaningful speach, it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization, I say almost, because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not, while being bad, theyre not terrible. But this makes it sound like a bad movie, which barbie is not, at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides. It is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous, when you have a movie thats like that all the time I dont think it matters all that much. And at the end of the day I took home with me the minutes of laughter this movie gave to me, an enjoying fun time that is worth watching.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 81}), Document(page_content=': 82\\nReview_Date: 20 July 2023\\nAuthor: moriumemoltre\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Great acting but why this movie?\\nReview: I was really surprised about how much i liked Ryan Gosling in this.

And me having my 13 year old daughter with me almost caused me to walk out of the theater. I kept on waiting for the writers to hit the direction of unity but it never came. After the movie my daughter brought up the message to me saying how she even noticed the weird agenda they're trying to push and said that is not a movie for the easily impressionable.

The film starts strong with an impeccable introduction referencing \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" and then transitions to the gigantic dollhouse that is Barbieland. The production design is simply incredible, the use of CGI is imperceptible, the practical effects are great, the costumes are unique, and the makeup and hair contribute to the excellent art direction. The performances are all good, especially those of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, who as Ken manage to steal the scenes several times. The weakest point lies in the script, which hits and misses at every moment. Its execution is good, the story itself works well, even without explaining some details. Nothing comes close to hindering the experience. Greta aims to deliver strong critiques and attempts to remain neutral, but at a specific moment, she forces it too much, causing a disconnection with the viewer. In the following scene, there\\'s a spectacular sequence involving Ken, creating a sensation that his storyline is better. It\\'s not; it\\'s just more entertaining. The only \"weak\" storyline is that of the human mother-daughter duo and the executives. It\\'s one of the weaker aspects of a good, fun, exciting, and creative film, which falls short of being even better due to stumbling over its details.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 87}), Document(page_content=': 88\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: captainsermig\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: It\\'s alright\\nReview: \"If you brought a 7 year old girl to see this movie she would neither have fun nor be happy at all\"\\nAnd this was my girlfriend\\'s statement as soon as we left the cinema.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 88}), Document(page_content=\": 89\\nReview_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: bm230199\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Heart-warming, serious and such an important movie for everyone to see!\\nReview: When I sat down to watch this film I assumed it would be some fun pink silly movie but it was not in the best possible way. It starts very much in that way but the second Barbie gets to the real world everything changes and the film makes so many important statements on sexism and the treatment of women. I thought it perfectly addressed the affect Barbie has had on the world and never shied away from it. This movie does not flinch away from the reality of the world or what damage ignorance can do (Ken). America Ferrera's speech is amazing and moved me so much as did Barbie's own found freedom. Robbie was an amazing Barbie and all the women shined in this movie...and Alan was pretty good too. It was everything you can want from a movie, sharp, whitty, moving, honest and progressive.

But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 91}), Document(page_content=\": 92\\nReview_Date: 28 July 2023\\nAuthor: edwardrevans\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Good but not for under 12's\\nReview: I saw this movie tonight and it was very entertaining but if your a parent and have young Children THEY WILL GET BORED as this is not a kids movie, it is on a higher intellectual plain than that.

She and partner Noah Baumbach have taken the Barbie mythos and built a multilayered narrative around the evolving nature of female identity and empowerment within the context of male dominance and the patriarchy that has defined sexual roles since the beginning of time. However, this is neither a treatise nor a polemic. It's still primarily a fun, free-wheeling farce with Day-Glo colors and silly choreography filling up the screen with zestful energy informed by a knowing perspective. Margot Robbie is ideally cast in the title role as she epitomizes stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives Ken the right level of disempowerment as he gets taken in by the lure of toxic masculinity. The rest of the cast appear equally game. Gerwig has truly applied a perceptive twist to a candy-coated girlhood memory.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 98}), Document(page_content=\": 99\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: trinculodino\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Witty, funny but severly sterotypical\\nReview: A good laugh of a film poking fun at Mattel, complicating the concept of Barbie while at the same time highligting the patriarchy and it's inherent incompatibility with human emancipation.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 99}), Document(page_content=': 100\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: MrDHWong\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: A darkly satirical look at gender structure in society\\nReview: \"Barbie\" is a comedy film based on the line of fashion dolls by Mattel.

Again honest - I went there just for Margot Robbie (I'm a married 34 year old male, and margot is one of my top 3 favorite actrices of all time, and arguably the most talented one from my list). And for that part it was totally ok. But the movie absolutely doesn't deserve an imdb rating above 5.6. The plot itself was very simple. Absolutely nothing particularly special in it. So if it is in fact getting rated so high just because of Margot alone, then why do her other movies don't get rated that well and get that much attention? Honestly I really don't understand and I think this movie is way too overhyped for no reason. And I have no idea why... For other movies that get hyped like that I do see the reasons why they're getting so hyped. So the movie is not awful, but it's rather average, if you're not going there specifically for Margot then I am pretty sure there will be multiple movies at your local cinema at the time you're reading this, which are way more worth watching than this one...\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 101}), Document(page_content=\": 102\\nReview_Date: 29 July 2023\\nAuthor: willsfamily11\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: It's not what you think.\\nReview: I am a MASSIVE and lifelong Barbie fanatic.

Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season.

Unfortunately, the film tries to be and do much more than what the filmmakers ultimately are able to control and reel in. That a movie about Barbie would be guilty of Americanization is no surprise, and in many ways more than befitting, but the Americanization here isn't just about the history of the toy itself and all its cultural impacts - Barbie also views everything through the eyes of Hollywood anno 2023 - which arguably is a very particular and perhaps not that representative outlook. Instead of utilizing the fine foundation laid in the film's first third, director and co-writer Greta Gervig (Lady Bird, Little Women) gets herself lost in a trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes, which will leave youths - and perhaps particularly Europeans - feeling confused and conflicted. The filmmakers' supposed toying with stereotypes ultimately becomes more of a playing into them, especially towards the end when Gerwig staggers along desperately looking for closure and something meaningful to say. Alas, Barbie has ended up as a rather sad symptom of our times, when it could have been the wonderfully funny piece of femininity-appraising escapism it started out as. There are nonetheless several highlights here, such as the delightfully absurd opening sequence (a fine nod to Kubrick's 2001), the initial introduction of Barbie and Ken's days in Barbieland, and - of course - their first encounter with the real world.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 106}), Document(page_content=': 107\\nReview_Date: 1 August 2023\\nAuthor: tforbes-2\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Mind blowing\\nReview: Barbie is simply a mind-blowing experience, and in a truly fine way!

The comedy in the movie is pretty funny too and got a few laughs from everyone in the cinema, the music is really nice and so are the choreographed dances. What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 110}), Document(page_content=\": 111\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: sriya-76870\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Boring Movie\\nReview: Dont fall for the 5 star reviews.

This film is a treat for Barbie lovers because the way director has told the storyline by introducing a whole barbie world and their characters is interesting to watch. Specially MARGOT ROBBIE what and actress she is her looks, style, acting performances, dresses of barbie all are top notch. Margot Robbie is perfectly suited for this role because she is the only one carrying the whole movie throughout the end. From start to end the main highlight of the this film is Margot Robbie. I've only watched this film for her and she has proved that currently she is one of the best actress in Hollywood. When I talk about supporting cast RYAN GOSLING is the only one who has done justice to the character of Ken rest are just average. Story is the main disappointment of the film, Film starts on a good note with laughs and riot of chaos when Barbie enters into the real world but after a bit of time story get exaggerated and only focuses on the central character which is the drawback of the film and from that case movie doesn't get the chance to give space to the other important characters. Background score and songs are good that wil give you a fresh vibe while watching this film. All n all this movie is a treat for Barbie fans and rest of the audience may consider as an average content....\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 116}), Document(page_content=\": 117\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: olelmao\\nRating: 4\\nReview_Title: Didn't meet my expectations\\nReview: I wanted to love this movie but it just wasn't it :(\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 117}), Document(page_content=': 118\\nReview_Date: 16 August 2023\\nAuthor: mollyt-73422\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Absolutely powerful movie and changed my perspective on life\\nReview: This movie is not for people who cry a lot.

This is the movie of our time - a film that shows us what life and society are like now, as well as shows us how we can do better. Plus, the movie is pure joy! It's a perfect mix of existentialism, heartfelt and important social-commentary and unapologetic silliness. This is the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - and yet thanks to Gerwig's incredible script it also manages to be very a profound exploration of feminism, existentialism, the patriarchy, and masculinity all packaged in a satirical musical comedy homage to the fabric of cinema.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 119}), Document(page_content=': 120\\nReview_Date: 3 August 2023\\nAuthor: PennyReviews\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Good Enough\\nReview: Barbie is a fun summery movie for all ages.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 120}), Document(page_content=\": 121\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: GusherPop\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Greta shows real power of woman in Barbie\\nReview: Greta Gerwig's Barbie explores creation myths in Barbieland, a parallel universe populated by Mattel dolls. The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation. The production design and costuming are exceptional, showcasing Gerwig's passion for details and her ability to create a dreamlike world. Barbieland is a feminist utopia in which Barbies serve as presidents, Supreme Court members, doctors, physicists, Nobel prize winners, and cancer cures. The dolls are not structurally different from our world, but they are represented by political fantasy and decade-dependent what-ifs. Barbie has gone to space, could vote, and own property before many human women, and her appearance has changed to mirror society's beauty politics. The representational doll has become an extension of political fantasy, reflecting the beauty politics of society. Gerwig features a cast of Barbies, including Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, and Hari Nef. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is the protagonist, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Barbie created by Ruth Handler. Her Ken counterpart, Ryan Gosling, is portrayed with humor and heart. They are a version of Eve and Adam, with their fall being dramatic. Barbie finds her perfect life hampered by existential thoughts and seeks answers from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a doll with a traumatic history. Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand. The film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest the film serves as a brand. Gerwig's film Barbieland is a mix of fun and emotional depth, with a tension between keeping Barbie entertaining and blending her source material with previous projects. After a detour, Barbie returns home to find Ken's patriarchal knowledge has transformed Barbieland. The screenplay, by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, avoids familiarity and mockery, but the moments that aren't just funny are buried in important monologues, making the gestures feel politically hollow. The film's mandate is too ambitious, making it feel politically hollow.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 121}), Document(page_content=\": 122\\nReview_Date: 30 July 2023\\nAuthor: Rice-and-Beans34\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: I don't get all the hype...\\nReview: This movie is many things. One may say it is a story of strength, and finding the beauty in yourself. Others, may just not like it. I am in the middle of all of that. The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 122}), Document(page_content=\": 123\\nReview_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: mafiagirl-21431\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: So fun and charming!\\nReview: So i've just got back from theaters and all i got to say is wow, that was such a fun, funny, charming movie and the Barbie world was just so colorful !

I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it fell short. Barbie takes us on a journey, with Margot Robbie portraying \"Stereotypical\" Barbie as she leaves her world of Barbieland and enters the Real World. She encounters friends, overcomes challenges, and discovers important lessons about herself and others. Barbie doesn\\'t always hit the mark while attempting to blend comedy, drama and fantasy elements. The plot feels predictable and filled with clichés, and the theme and tone are sometimes inconsistent and confusing. The acting and characters come across as stereotypes (something expected in Barbieland but not in the Real World).\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 124}), Document(page_content=': 125\\nReview_Date: 13 August 2023\\nAuthor: scottt1bbs\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Super fun!!

The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it. Really wasn't happy with the movie.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 147}), Document(page_content=\": 148\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: mckai-89546\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: Best for Ryan Gosling Gives a really great performance acting\\nReview: I am a man but watched this movie it's awesome Margot Robbie very beautiful but i like the performance of Ryan Gosling a lot this movie It's full of imagination and it surprises me a lot.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 148}), Document(page_content=\": 149\\nReview_Date: 30 July 2023\\nAuthor: walfordior\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: This is more than just a 'lighthearted comedy'\\nReview: Barbie is no longer just a toy; rather, this idea of 'Barbie' has evolved into one of the most famous and significant topics in the world at this moment in time.

This was supposed to be like a childrens show with adult humor and topics but I didnt find most of the jokes funny, i felt like they were just screaming stuff in your face instead of being more subtle. I wish some aspects of the characters and side stories were explored more. The ending was okay but i wished for something diffrent and again more about the side characters. Ken is a cool character i gotta say. He deserves the world and to really find something more about him. So i wouldn't say it was a bad movie, its okay to watch more casually, more so to appreciate the dolls and the nostalgia. I was lowkey dissapointment with all the hype i gotta say.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 150}), Document(page_content=': 151\\nReview_Date: 26 July 2023\\nAuthor: sanadalsalt\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: An Unforgettable Delight!\\nReview: Oh, where do I even begin?

The fact that it paid homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey\\'s opening sequence earned it extra points for me! Ryan Gosling was great and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast, and the production design was fantastic. A comedy movie should mainly be judged on its comedy, and Barbie for the most part is actually quite funny! I also loved how the narrator speaks over the movie at certain points and delivers some funny lines. This may get some backlash, but I feel Barbie is a movie that earns popularity because it propagates feminist ideals and speaks to the issues women face today, and audiences are willing to look past its flaws to celebrate the movie because the message it portrays is very relevant in society today. I feel the same way with Sound of Freedom. Just because a movie talks about issues you care about, however important they may be, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s the \"greatest movie of all time\" and \"Oscar-worthy\" etc. The plot of Barbie seemed quite interesting to me, how Barbie goes into the real world and the chaos that could cause. But I feel like the movie got TOO drenched in the social commentary and thus didn\\'t give the creative plot idea enough justice. Movies don\\'t have to be so explicit with the social commentary, as shown by movies like 12 Angry Men (1957), which IMO does a far better job at tackling racism and prejudice than any film made today. At certain times, Barbie really blurred the line between being anti-patriarchy and being anti-men. It felt like it was fighting injustice with more injustice, although not throughout.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 154}), Document(page_content=\": 155\\nReview_Date: 8 August 2023\\nAuthor: cjgvfpkx\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: I didn't think it would be good.\\nReview: But damnit, it was GREAT. The opening scene was good, then the first scene in Barbieland worried me. Not worried me like it would be bad, but that I would be right: that it would be good by virtue of being so over the top. And it was that too. But it's a surprisingly serious movie. In theme, not execution. But it says a lot of quiet parts out loud. What we did with our Barbies. To them. Who is Ken anyway? Why is Ken? What is death and why does it matter? What is motivation and what is success? What is feminism and what is dementia t progress? Honestly. I would have thought you were blowing my horn. And that sounds fun for a Friday night, but this is worth it. And a good movie to brave the theater for. The link was weird but vibrant and balanced in a way the big screen really lit up.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 155}), Document(page_content=\": 156\\nReview_Date: 24 July 2023\\nAuthor: bobbygordon-92171\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: I don't know how to describe\\nReview: The movie was weirdly quick at the beginning and weirdly long at the end. The beginning of the film felt like a glorified way to show off Margot Robbie's feet. The movie it self was quite meta at times and even made me laugh but I felt like it had too much hype. Also was the movie about sexism or getting older and was Will Ferril the villain or was Ken. There were just somethings that didn't need to be in this. Greta Gerwig is a great director Wonder Woman proves that it's just this movie could have been different. I Manley started re-enjoying the movie was when the kens had their battle.

Barbie started off strong and Ryan Gosling is very funny in the movie. The problem is none of the Barbies are in a comedy. This movie should have been 90 minutes of comedy. It maybe could have had a simple heartfelt moment between a mom and her daughter but this movie has several preachy moments that made me wonder, who is this movie for? Little girls won't enjoy this, teenage girls won't enjoy this, adult women won't enjoy this. So who is the target audience? Who are the preachy moments for? If you are thinking of watching something this month, choose Sound of Freedom or Mission Impossible.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 157}), Document(page_content=': 158\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: anthonywltrs\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Full of Surprises\\nReview: This movie, wow.

It was so human and it spoke to me. So when Barbie was released, there was no doubt I will like this film-but not this much. In 114 minutes, Greta serves everything that she intended sending a beautiful positive message about womanhood. What it means to be human, what it means to live in this broken patriarchal system. The message is clear: to be human is to feel. This movie is funny. And as someone who is not a fan of American humor, that's a big one. But I laughed through the entire movie. I also shared a tear. I loved America's monologue about womanhood. I loved Dame Helen Mirren as a narrator-great choice. Margot is a star. Her Barbie is so authentic. She portrays comedy, as well as the emotional part of the character so well. That last scene was so good. Now I can't skip the star of the film, and that is Ryan Gossling. Ken was hilarious and I will quote him for the rest of my life. But also shows that Greta is sweet to men offering them compassion by showing them that they are enough as it is, they don't have to be more than that. Greta (and Noah), really made a beautiful love letter to womanhood by showing all the parts of it-please the scene with the old lady had my heart. Overall it's already classic and the movie, that will probably be one of my comfort movies.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 161}), Document(page_content=': 162\\nReview_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: lisafordeay\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: A very enjoyable film\\nReview: Barbie is the latest toy being turned into a live action movie and stars Margot Robbie(Suicide Squad), Ryan Gosling(La La Land),Michael Cena(Scott Pilgram Vs The World),Alexandra Shipp(A Dogs Way Home),America Ferrara (Ugly Betty)and Will Ferrell(Elf).

The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is magnificent and together with the production design they bring a fictional country full of fantastic and pink plastics. The soundtrack is tremendous, with a list of songs wisely chosen (with some exceptions). The cast is tremendous, Margot Robbie\\'s performance is realistic and sentimental, proving to be the perfect Barbie in all aspects. Ryan Gosling plays Ken with humor and also gives him perfect dramatic nuances. America Ferrara as a working mother achieves a performance to remember, especially for her powerful monologue. Kate McKinnon gives a highly comic performance and an endearing character of a very unusual Barbie. Rhea Perlman pulls off an incredible performance wittily balancing comedy and drama. Ann Roth in a special participation of a single dialogue and a smile achieved a sublime and unforgettable performance. Helen Mirren with a voice acting as The Narrator describes everything with feeling and passion taking advantage of her imposing voice. Greta Gerwig\\'s work as a director is genius, she manages to capture the ideas of the script, gives it her own style and pays homage to movie classics. \"Barbie\" is the movie event of the year, a rightfully earned title for this current classic.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 172}), Document(page_content=\": 173\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: daniel-smits-03179\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: It was pretty good but not worthy of the hype\\nReview: Barbie was an entertaining movie, but was definitely not worth the hype that accompanied the film.

I saw this movie on July 23rd and I've been thinking about it ever since. Right off the bat, the first thing that has to be mentioned is the absolutely stunning and wildly impressive set design. The backdrops, the houses, all of the set decoration in Barbieland is PERFECTION. All of the travel sequences are so fun and beautiful and creative. I would love to believe that Barbie can help usher in a new era, where we can go back to at least having some movie with real honest to god set design in a sound stage, without so much CGI.

However, I won\\'t lie to you and say that it\\'s really all that groundbreaking as some seem to claim. While this movie focuses on heavy topics such as inequality and feminism, some of the scenes that had primarily concentrated on them had felt a little shallow. I am not saying that this wasn\\'t a great film, as said before, it delivered most if not all of the checkpoints that modern day society defines a \"good movie\" with. Now I can\\'t say that I wasn\\'t entertained mostly through the movie but it just lacked something. The longer this film had stuck with me the longer it felt insufficient. People that are currently speaking on this movie seem to pin up its success in presenting femininity and women\\'s issues in a lighthearted and joyful manner, however I feel that the overall message in this movie could have been provided in a more severe tone. The creators of Barbie stated that this was an \"everyone movie\", that this film was designed to cater to all viewers, but did it have to? The laughable tone this movie brought along with its own narrative of modern day feminism sort of cheapened the message. Don\\'t get me wrong, all the acting in the movie was phenomenal for the roles each actor portrayed, but it felt like some of the plot had gotten lost in translation. Even after watching the movie twice I still am a little fuzzy on the entirety of \"Barbieland\". Where is this really set?, why it is a common occurrence of dolls making their way into the real world?, why do barbies know they\\'re toys? I might just be inattentive but these plot point were rarely touched on through the film and still leave me confused. Overall I think my main issue with this film is my regrettable rating, I really didn\\'t want this movie to be below a 9. I was really looking forward to this film and eagerly waiting to \"do anything to see it in theaters again\", but it turned out to be just ok. A word I can describe my expectations for this movie is iconic, but it just fell flat in that department. Would I recommend? Yeah why not, but would I jump at the opportunity to see it again ever? Probably not.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 183}), Document(page_content=': 184\\nReview_Date: 2 August 2023\\nAuthor: nikitacpv\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: Just good fun and a great soundtrack\\nReview: Even though I never played with Barbie myself, when word came out of a Barbie movie being released, I knew I had to watch it!.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 184}), Document(page_content=': 185\\nReview_Date: 2 August 2023\\nAuthor: prberg2\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Well made movie but a little uneven\\nReview: Barbie was a fun movie and it visually looked really original.

Barbie and Ken escape from Barbieland into the real world, threatening societal breakdown in both as changes in one universe affects the other. Barbieland is effectively a Matriarchy where girls rule and the Kens just do Beach, play sports, stand around and try to attract the attention of the Barbies. There are all types of Barbies, President Barbie, the Supreme Court Barbie, Roadworker Barbies. Margot Robbie is Stereotypical Barbie with Ryan Gosling as her Beach Ken. They travel to the real world after Barbie starts developing cellulite and worrying about death. Ken learns about patriarchy in the real world, especially from the clever corporate types who affect an image of equality but use this as a cover to carry on in the old manner. Ken returns to Barbieland intent on turning it into a Kendom and turning the world upside down. Barbie faces the all male Executive board of Mattel where the CEO (Ken Ferrell) defends his policies but literally tries to put Batbie in a box. . Cutting satire, great humour in a whipsmart script with wonderful fake pastel sets in Barbieland. The themes and set decoration bring Don't Worry Darling and Asteroid City to mind. Kate McKinnon is Weird Barbie who helps Stereotypical Barbie to solve her personal problems and to battle against the Kendom. I'll have to see this again. I reckon to properly appreciate all the jokes, irony and satire. Greta Gerwig takes no prisoners as she Directs and Co-Writes (with Noah Baumbach) this comic masterpiece. 9/10.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 186}), Document(page_content=\": 187\\nReview_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: jcollins-458-415387\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Just enjoy it.

I personally wouldn't show this movie to a child TOO young as there are a few jokes about how barbie's don't have genitals, one bleeped f word, and a few mentions of beer. It was a LITTLE depressing, but overall very inspirational. Despite, of course, the discussion of misogyny, I laughed through the whole thing. It was hilarious. It addressed also how adult women/mothers feel self conscious about not being perfect.

There isn't anything quite like it and, although it essentially serves as one giant advertisement for its eponymous doll, it feels like a genuine piece of almost outsider art with a great sense of humour and a ton of heart. It's an incredibly well-crafted feature. The cinematography, set design and costuming all hit the nail squarely on the head, to the point that the pastel plastic aesthetic of Barbieland is so compelling and so complete that it honestly feels as though the movie has become live-action once Barbie and Ken make their way to the real world (even though the flick has been live-action since its first frame). The performances help with this, too, as the actors not only throw themselves from head to toe into the absurdity needed to fully embody the unreal nature of their characters but also deliver their lines with pitch-perfect timing and genuine emotion. All the Barbies and all the Kens (and Allan) are great, but Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling truly are the stars here. The former is absolutely brilliant, nailing the emotional dichotomy of her character's mindset as she undergoes her journey, and the latter just seems as though he's having a great time, living that quintessential Ken lifestyle without an ounce of embarrassment. It's also nice to see Will Ferrell being funny again, popping up as a CEO who seems like he just might be Buddy the Elf all grown up (it's not like he ever stopped being funny, per se, but he's been in some rough movies recently), and America Ferrera is great in her more down-to-Earth yet refreshingly honest role.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 192}), Document(page_content=': 193\\nReview_Date: 1 August 2023\\nAuthor: jboothmillard\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Barbie\\nReview: The first Barbie fashion doll was released by Mattel in 1954, there have been several straight-to-DVD computer-animated cartoons, but it has taken 64 for a live-action movie to be made. This was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year, I certainly couldn\\'t ignore it, directed by Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women). Basically, the film opens with the Narrator (Dame Helen Mirren) explaining the history of dolls before the introduction of Barbie (a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey) and how Barbie came to change the world. Barbieland is a matriarchal society where all ranges of living Barbie and Ken dolls reside. All the women are self-confident, self-sufficient, and successful, while the men spend their days engaging in recreational activities at the beach. All Barbies hold all important job positions such as doctors, lawyers, journalists, pilots, astronauts, and politicians. \"Stereotypical\" Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives her best life all day every day, while her on-off boyfriend Ken (Ryan Gosling) is only happy when he is with her, and she shows him some attention. Ken seeks a closer relationship, but Barbie rebuffs him to be independent and continue her female friendships. Barbie holds one of her regular parties at her Dreamhouse, which momentarily halts when she asks a question about mortality. The following day, Barbie finds her regular routine has altered, her raised feet have gone flat and she has cellulite. Her friends, including Writer Barbie (Alexandra Shipp), Physicist Barbie (Emma Mackey) and Lawyer Barbie (Sharon Rooney) tell her to visit Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a wise but disfigured outcast who was played with badly, giving her permanent splits and felt-tip pen drawn on her face. Weird Barbie tells her to cure her affliction, she must go to the real world and find the child playing with her. Weird Barbie does offer her the option to take her heal shoe and everything will return to normal but really wants her to take the second option (a parody of The Matrix). Driving her pink convertible outside of Barbieland, Barbie finds Ken stowed away, he insists he is coming with her, and she reluctantly agrees. Barbie and Ken travel by car, by boat, by rocket, by bicycle, by campervan, and by snowmobile (all deliberate cut-out scenarios), until they arrive at Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California. The two cause a stir while exploring, including with their colourful roller-skating gear and blades, then changing into cowboy outfits. At toy manufacturer Mattel, the creators of Barbie, the all-male board members are informed that Barbie has entered the real world. The CEO (Will Ferrell) orders her to be captured and brought to them to be put back in her box. At the local school, Barbie encounters a tween girl named Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) who criticises Barbie dolls for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards and attitudes about women. Meanwhile, Ken explores the city and learns about the patriarchal system, mistakenly believing it was all started by men and horses. It is through simple interactions with people that he feels respected and accepted for the first time; with everything he has learned he returns to Barbieland. Feeling distraught by Sasha\\'s comments, Barbie soon meets Sasha\\'s mother Gloria (Ugly Betty\\'s America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the person who was playing with her. Gloria is the catalyst of her existential crisis; she was playing with Sasha\\'s old Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Barbie. Soon, Mattel agents arrive and take Barbie to headquarters. They attempt to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha\\'s help. During the pursuit, Barbie enters a room containing a 1950s home scenario and encounters an elderly lady (Rhea Perlman) who recognises her. Returning to Barbieland, they discover that it has changed dramatically. The Kens have taken over, while Barbies have been reduced to submissive roles, such as maids, housewives, and agreeable girlfriends. Barbie tries to convince Ken and the Barbies to return to the way things were, only to be rebuffed. Barbie becomes depressed and returns to Weird Barbie and her group of discontinued dolls. Gloria gives an inspirational speech about society\\'s conflicting expectations of women, and Barbie\\'s self-confidence is restored. Meanwhile, the CEO and board members are making their way to Barbieland. With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Ken\\'s friend Allan (Michael Cera), a lone and discontinued character, and other discontinued dolls, Gloria repeats her moving words to all Barbies to snap them out of their subordinate behaviours. Ken intends to cement the changes to Barbieland and create male superiority by changing the constitution, allowing men to become President and replace all other roles taken by the women. The restored Barbies manipulate the Kens to fight against each other to distract them from the alterations. The Barbies regain their positions of power but also realise the errors of Barbieland\\'s previous societal system. They decide to make changes, including better treatment for the Kens and all outcast dolls. Barbie and Ken apologise to each other and acknowledge their failings. Ken feels that he has no identity or purpose without Barbie, she encourages him to find himself. Barbie remains unsure of her own purpose and identity. She suddenly finds herself in a heavenly place where she encounters the elderly lady again, revealing herself to be the spirit of Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler. Ruth explains that she created Barbie as a toy that represented what girls \"wanted to be\"; she named \"Barbie\" after her daughter Barbara. After a montage of home footage of young girls playing, Ruth explains that Barbie\\'s story has no set ending. After the Barbies, Kens, and Mattel executives bid Barbie goodbye, she decides to become human and return to the real world. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband (Ryan Piers Williams), and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name \"Barbara Handler\", to a building for an appointment, and she enters asking to see her gynaecologist. Also starring Issa Rae as President Barbie, Hari Nef as Dr. Barbie, Shang-Chi\\'s Simu Liu as Tourist Ken, Kingsley Ben-Adir as Basketball Ken, Sex Education\\'s Ncuti Gatwa as Artist Ken, Jamie Demetriou as Mattel CFO, Scott Evans as Stereotypical Ken, Ana Cruz Kayne as Judge Barbie, Ritu Arya as Journalist Barbie, Derry Girls\\' Nicola Coughlan as Diplomat Barbie, Dua Lipa as the Mermaid Barbies, John Cena as Ken Merman, Asim Chaudhry as Warehouse Employee, Ray Fearon as Dan at the FBI, Erica Ford as Skipper, Emerald Fennell as Midge, Lucy Boynton as Proust Barbie, Rob Brydon as Sugar Daddy Ken, and costume designer Ann Roth as the Woman on the Bench. Robbie is gorgeous and perfectly cast as the loveable \"stereotypical\" Barbie going on an adventure, Gosling as the muscly, foolish, attention-seeking Ken is splendid, McKinnon is hilarious as the mangled Weird Barbie, Ferrera is good support, Ferrell is amusing, many other supporting cast members and the cameo performers are terrific, and the voice of Mirren (occasionally breaking the fourth wall) is great. Gerwig and her co-writer/real-life partner Noah Baumbach (Frances Ha, Marriage Story) were given full creative freedom for the script. They are unafraid to poke fun at the Barbie world, including many references to discontinued lines and how kids play with the toys, and interesting ideas of feminism, body image, female empowerment, the battle of the sexes, and the human experience. The visuals are sugar-coated and saturated with colour, pink obviously most prominent, with impressive set and costume design, and the soundtrack of catchy pop songs (\"Pink\" by Lizzo, \"Dance the Night\" by Dua Lipa) (the original \"Barbie Girl\" by Aqua does not feature?!, there is the new version by Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice with Aqua) and fun song and dance routines. It could have been a conventional girly Barbie film with a dull love story or something and a happy ending, but it goes the other direction and benefits completely with its deliberately surreal and cheesy approach, a bonkers but inventive and worthwhile fantasy comedy. Very good!\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 193}), Document(page_content=\": 194\\nReview_Date: 10 August 2023\\nAuthor: samann888\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Unexpected joy watching this film\\nReview: Wasn't sure how good this film was going to be but the trailer suggested something magical and the film fulfilled my vision.

It tries to appeal to both young girls and adults it seems, but this leads it to be very inconsistent with its humor. Margot Robbie does a fantastic job as Barbie and especially the opening works really well in highlighting the absurdity of Barbie's world, where its houses are all open and have no stairs, and its showers have no water and the fridge is filled with a drawing of groceries. All that works fantastic. But mixed into this is a lot of adult humor and sexual innuendo, which makes for a strange mix. It isn't until after the first act, where the movie tries to be more than just a movie about toys, that it kind of falls apart.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 195}), Document(page_content=': 196\\nReview_Date: 20 July 2023\\nAuthor: rockettbootz\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Such a lovely film\\nReview: I absolutely loved the barbie movie, the movie had such a beautiful message and Margot is just exceptional.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 196}), Document(page_content=': 197\\nReview_Date: 24 July 2023\\nAuthor: johnhf-88111\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Barbie Review\\nReview: Released: 21st July 2023 (UK)\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 197}), Document(page_content=': 198\\nReview_Date: 15 August 2023\\nAuthor: ThereelscoopwithKK\\nRating: 4\\nReview_Title: Great Casting: But is it Satire or Social Commentary?\\nReview: The casting for the roles is pretty well spot on.

And who would walk away from the perfect summer time movie that features Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling? I mean just based on curiosty alone, what would a movie about a child's doll be about? So off to the movies we went. And after the first 2 minutes, I was already having a bad feeling about this one.....and I really wanted to like it. As expected, much of the movie happens in BarbieLand, a perfect little beach front community where everyone cherishes Barbie. Lots of singing and dancing, colorful scenery, character introductions and so forth. You wonder where the story is going and out of the blue comes the theme of death. So at this point, its no longer a kids movie IMO. And the story developes into Barbie's mission to cross in to the real world to save the person who's not happy with their Barbie doll. And by not happy, I mean depressed with thoughts of death. A pretty dark twist. So the mission begins with Ken and Barbie visiting LA. The story becomes a mix of several themes including female enpowerment, corporate greed and a push for a male dominated society. Although I chuckled a couple times, this movie never sucked me into the story to the point where I felt I wasnt in a theater, if you know what I mean. In fact, it felt like every 15 minutes I was hoping the movie was over. Margot and Ryan give outstanding performances, but the novelty of Barbieland quickly wears off, leaving the audience blasted with bubblegum pop music and watching Barbie disolve into an emotional trainwreck as she faces a personal identity chrisis. Of course, this becomes the stories message to tweens, that life's hard, its OK to fail and finding strength to succeed isnt easy, regardless of gender. Its an awkward movie in that it doesnt really fit for kids or adults, unless you ignore the story and just look at the pictures.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 207}), Document(page_content=': 208\\nReview_Date: 25 July 2023\\nAuthor: SureCommaNot\\nRating: 3\\nReview_Title: Hardly any laughter in my theater, though perhaps the film wasn\\'t meant to entertain\\nReview: In one sense, this film was more inevitable than Thanos. What do you get when you\\'re part of a society that fuels existential crises, by constantly eroding definitions and structures? Barbie and Ken aren\\'t exactly human (they don\\'t even have genitals); they\\'re embodied ideas, and so they face this amorphous crisis of identity that pits their presuppositional views of a happy society against that of the \"real world.\" But their perception of the real world is like seeing a plane for the first time and therefore thinking it\\'s a dragon. So how much can an audience glean from the pontifications of characters who are essentially children? I would have greatly preferred scriptwriters more well-versed in sociology as well as comedy, writers who understand not only American ideals, and how those ideals have shifted, but the role that Barbie has played along the way. I get the sense that the writers here just KNOW Barbie had some impact, without really understanding much beyond that. There was so much to explore, and it could have been shown situationally, rather than through heavy-handed exposition.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 208}), Document(page_content=\": 209\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: hilly-97876\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Another Greta masterpiece\\nReview: Never have I ever experienced this much fun during a movie.

Broadly, this trend holds true even when a message is important, admirable, and agreeable. Case in point, last year's slasher 'They/them' was troubled in various ways, but above all in how immensely upfront it was about its otherwise gratifying messaging; sure enough, the writing suffered in turn. This 2023 film is not free of that same issue, for it is extremely, emphatically forthright and downright strident about the ideas at the root of the screenplay and which it wishes to convey; they're terrific ideas, but literally from the very beginning we see and hear exactly, indisputably, what the script wants to communicate. More than that, this is a picture that strives to be, say, and do a lot, and in fact it is, says, and does so much that it's a little overwhelming - I earnestly think the finished product would have benefited from some thoughts being left out so as to tighten the whole and assert greater focus. And though I somewhat repeat myself, it's well worth accentuating that the feature is majorly heavy-handed, with astonishingly little of the content being given a delicate, nuanced touch for the viewer to pick up on or feel for ourselves. It's a title that wears its neon pink heart on its sleeve, and there's no possibility of missing it.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 212}), Document(page_content=': 213\\nReview_Date: 11 August 2023\\nAuthor: julietteshinta\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Starts well.. but then..\\nReview: Barbie made a strong start really.

I interpreted the overall point of the movie to be that today's feminism has gone a little overboard and has put way too much pressure on women to feel like we have to be the career driven, leader boss b*itch to have a meaningful life. This movie voices that sometimes women (while respecting the women that do) don't want to be a leader, who's a mom and has the career. Sometimes we just want to be average and that's ok. I also felt the mother and daughter scenes in the movie tug at my heart and GG did a great job and adding those pieces throughout the movie. While I agree that it was annoying how the Kens were treated at the beginning of the movie, I felt the ending tied it all together. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. As humans I think we sometimes find ourselves wondering what was I made for? And even though this was referring to Barbie, it can be very relatable.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9213569/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 214}), Document(page_content=\": 215\\nReview_Date: 10 August 2023\\nAuthor: snowadian\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Are we still in the 60's lol?\\nReview: I feel like we as a society can't move past our parents and grandparents battles... women in first world civilizations have it better than ever (spoiler alert, it'll only get so good).

I had high hopes for the movie, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. The story felt forced, and the narrative lacked a decisive direction. There were moments of humor, but it missed the opportunity to be hilariously entertaining. The film could have been much better if they had taken advantage of the potential for creative and imaginative storytelling that the Barbie franchise offers. Despite the visually appealing scenes, the overall execution left me feeling unsatisfied. I hoped for a more captivating and memorable experience, but unfortunately, it fell short of delivering that.
